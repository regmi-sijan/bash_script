A **shell** is a powerful user interface for UNIX-like operating system. It can interpret commands, and run other programs.

### Working with files
```
$ cp      // copy file
$ mv      // mv file (use to rename file as well)
$ touch     // create empty file, or mostly used to update the timestamp a file
$ chmod     // change/modify file permissions (more later)
$ wc          // get counts of lines, words, characters in file (mostly used to count line with -l option)
$ grep        // return line(s) in file matching the pattern
```
